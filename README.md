# Exoplanet-Artificial-Intelligence
Searching for Exoplanets using Artificial Intelligence

White Paper Link: (Currently in review at MNRAS) 

This project uses machine learning to search for transiting exoplanets in planetary search surveys. Multiple neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from artificial light curves that mimic real observations. The trained networks are validated with real data using the known ephemerii of transiting planets disovered from the [Kepler](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html) mission.

Dependencies: 
  * Numpy
  * Keras
  * TensorFlow
  * Matplotlib 
  * Scikit-learn
